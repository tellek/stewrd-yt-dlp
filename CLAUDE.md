# Rules

## MANDATORY
- **NEVER** specify a color manually, instead **ALWAYS** select a variable from the color palette to identify a color so that it is controllable by theme changes
- All titles and button text should be Title case. IE: "Create New Palette", NOT "Create new palette"

## General
- When changes are completed in this project **ALWAYS** do the following:
    1. Always update README.md to reflect the change if the change is significant enough for this
    2. If it was a code change: Extecute all tests, fix any that are broken by fixing the related code, not the test(unless the test code truly is broken)
    3. Commit and push directly to main branch (do **NOT** create a pull request)
    4. If it was a code change: Execute ./build-release.bat yourself — do not ask Topher to run it
- ARCHITECTURE.md is a good source to grep for details around this project this plugin will run in but shouldnt be necessary to load into context
- build-release.bat is intended as a local development tool to quickly move the plugin over to the folder where I run stewrd so the plugin may be tested by me in the app. Claude should run it directly after every code change, not hand it back to Topher.

# Building a Stewrd plugin

This file ships inside every Stewrd install's `plugins/` folder so an AI coding
assistant opened here already knows how to build one. It's a condensed,
install-time version of the repo's `ARCHITECTURE.md` (also shipped, one level
up at `../ARCHITECTURE.md` — read it for full host internals, the plugin
sections here are the same information, just self-contained).

**Which context am I in?** If the folder *above* this one contains
`package.json` and `src-tauri/`, you're inside the Stewrd source repo, not a
real install — use `npm run plugin:build -- plugins/<id>` (the repo's own
build path, already wired into `build-release.bat`) and skip the standalone
build steps below entirely. Everything past this point assumes a real,
repo-less install (just `stewrd.exe`, `plugins/`, `assets/`, etc.).

## Start from the template

Copy `plugins/_template/` wholesale, rename the folder, and update
`plugin.json`'s `id`/`name` and `settings.json`'s `category`/`version` to
match. `_template/index.tsx` has a commented-out example of every API surface
below — uncomment what you need. `_template/README.md` covers the same ground
as this file with a live component-library coverage table; `_template/demos/`
has one file per UI component category.

## Host Integrations & Enforced Styles (Checklist)

Everything the host provides or enforces for a plugin. Look up the named
API/file before building anything that touches one of these.

**Sidebar & status indicators**
- Sidebar name: `plugin.json` `name`.
- Sidebar icon: drop `icon.png` in the plugin folder. It renders as a
  theme-tinted CSS mask (source colors ignored, transparency required). If
  it's missing, the host shows the fallback "more" icon. Idle tint is
  `palette.text` (`palette.accent` on hover) in the expanded sidebar and
  `palette.textMuted` in the collapsed rail.
- Sidebar icon alert/status color: `api.statusIcon.set(color, tooltip?)`
  recolors the whole sidebar icon (`idle | in-progress | success | warning |
  error`).
  - It's a silent no-op before the sidebar entry exists (early `activate()`
    in `background: true` plugins).
  - Status persists across hot-reload and the host never clears it. Call
    `statusIcon.set("idle")` in `activate()` (see `_template/index.tsx`).
  - A load/activate failure auto-sets `error` and the pane shows an error
    message.
- Category icon tint: the worst status among a category's plugins
  (error > warning > in-progress > success) tints the category icon
  automatically.
- Taskbar overlay dot (Windows): shows the worst status across all plugins
  once it reaches the Settings > General threshold. It's driven only by
  `statusIcon`.
- Tick watchdog: a tick handler hung for more than 30s sets status
  `warning`. A throwing tick is logged as an error but does not change the
  icon, so set `error` yourself.
- Sidebar sub-items: `api.sidebar.setItems([{ id, label, icon?, color?,
  onClick }])` / `setSelected(id)`.
  - `color` is a `StatusColor` dot. If you omit it, the host still draws a
    `textMuted` dot.
  - `setItems([])` hides them. They never render in the collapsed rail.
  - The host owns and persists the expand/collapse state.
- Sidebar category: the `settings.json` `"category"` value must match a
  Settings > Categories id or the plugin lands in "Other". Dragging a plugin
  to another category rewrites that key.
- Status bar: plugins get no direct slot. `api.log.info/warn/error` lines
  appear there (idle/warning/error colors) and in `stewrd.log`. Uncaught
  errors and unhandled rejections are routed there automatically.
- Toasts: `api.toast.show({ title?, message, kind?, durationMs? })`. `kind`
  maps to `palette.status`.
- Modals: `api.modal.error/info/question/confirm`. They're host-rendered and
  queued one at a time.
- Error boundary: a render throw shows an inline card with a "Reload this
  plugin" button.
- Settings > Plugins > Configure edits the plugin's `settings.json` as raw
  JSON.

**Pane container (forced by the host)**
- A plugin renders in only one pane at a time.
- The pane is a flex column with `padding: 16`, so don't add your own outer
  padding.
- The active pane gets a 2px `palette.accent` outline.
- With more than one pane open, a close "✕" button sits at the pane's
  top-right (`top: 4, right: 4`). Keep that corner clear.
- `Blanket`/`Drawer`/`InlineDialog` are scoped to the pane's content area.

**Styles**
- Colors: take them only from `api.theme.palette` (`background, surface,
  surfaceHover, text, textMuted, border, accent, status.*`). Use `subscribe`
  for live theme switches. Never use a literal hex.
- Title Case for all titles and button text.
- Use only `api.ui.*` components, never raw `<button>`/`<input>`/`<select>`.
  Check `_template/demos/` and `_template/index.tsx` for an existing example
  first.
- Buttons: `TextButton` / `IconButton` / `IconTextButton`, with
  `variant: "primary" | "secondary"`.
- Icons/images: pass `data:` URLs (`import` or `api.fs.readDataUrl`). Use
  `MaskIcon` for theme-tinted icons.
- `Banner.tone`: only `StatusColor | "accent" | "surface"`.
- Typography: inherit the host font (Inter stack, 16px / 24px line-height,
  `box-sizing: border-box`). Don't override it globally.
- Hover convention: text turns `palette.accent` and the background turns
  `palette.surfaceHover`.
- Scrollbars: the host pane is `overflow: auto` with an unstyled scrollbar.
  Make your root `flex: 1; minHeight: 0`, put `overflow: auto` on your own
  container, and style it with `scrollbarStyle(palette)` from
  `_template/demos/TextAreaDemo.tsx`.

**Runtime hooks & limits**
- `ctx.tick` handles scheduled work. It's throttled while the window is
  minimized.
- For work that must survive a minimized window, use Rust `start_interval` /
  `interval-tick:<key>` (see the `ctx.tick` row below). Key it by a
  per-activation value, not the plugin id: hot-reload runs the new
  `activate()` before the old `onDispose`, which would stop a shared key.
- Cleanup: use `ctx.signal` / `ctx.onDispose`. Spawned processes are not
  auto-killed.
- `api.statusIcon`/`log`/`toast`/`sidebar` throw after deactivation or
  hot-reload. Check `ctx.signal.aborted` before calling them from async
  callbacks.
- The only importable bare specifiers are `react`, `react-dom`,
  `react-dom/client`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `@tauri-apps/api/core` and
  `@tauri-apps/api/event`.
  - Other `@tauri-apps/api/*` imports build fine but fail at load.
  - Raw `invoke` reaches only host-registered commands. Plugins can't add
    Rust commands.
- Other surfaces:
  - `api.storage`: per-plugin JSON, no secrets.
  - `api.fs`: sandboxed to `data/`. `watchFile` is a no-op stub.
  - `api.shell`: pass the program and args separately, never a shell string.
  - `api.ai`: headless `claude` CLI.

## `plugin.json`

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "icon": "default",
  "entry": "dist/index.js",
  "description": "What this plugin does",
  "apiVersion": "1",
  "background": false
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier; should match the folder name. Used for storage/fs namespacing, hot-reload matching, boot-safety marks. |
| `name` | Sidebar display name. |
| `icon` | Unused — reserved. Drop `icon.png` into the plugin's own folder for a sidebar icon instead; it renders as a theme-tinted CSS mask. |
| `entry` | Always `dist/index.js` — the **built** output. You write `index.tsx`; esbuild produces this. |
| `description` | Shown in discovery-error messages/tooling. |
| `apiVersion` | Must equal `"1"` (the host's current supported version) or discovery rejects the plugin with a clear error. |
| `background` | `true` = activate eagerly at startup for off-screen work (pollers). `false` (default) = activate lazily on first sidebar selection. |

Optionally drop a `settings.json` next to `plugin.json` — a plain JSON object,
not a schema. The host only reads two keys: `"category"` (sidebar grouping —
must match a category id from Settings > Categories, else it lands under
"Other") and `"version"` (informational, shown in Settings > Plugins).
Everything else in the file is yours to define and read back via your own
`ctx.api.shell.exec`-based workaround if needed (there's no built-in way to
read your own custom settings keys at runtime otherwise). Example:

```json
{
  "category": "Utilities",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "refreshSeconds": 30
}
```

Users edit this file via **Settings > Plugins > Configure** (raw JSON, not a
generated form). Omit the file entirely if you have nothing to configure.

## Plugin module contract

Your built `dist/index.js` must export:

```ts
interface PluginModule {
  activate(ctx: PluginContext): void | Promise<void>;
  deactivate?(): void | Promise<void>;
  Component: React.ComponentType<{ api: PluginApi }>;
}
```

The host renders `<mod.Component api={...} />` directly inside its own React
tree — your component gets hooks and behaves like any other component, even
though it was never bundled with the host.

## Lifecycle

1. **Discover** — the host scans `plugins/` for subfolders with a valid
   `plugin.json` + built `entry` file. A folder with no `plugin.json` is
   silently skipped; one with a `plugin.json` that fails to parse, has the
   wrong `apiVersion`, or is missing its built entry shows up as a discovery
   error instead.
2. **Load** — `background: true` plugins load immediately at startup;
   everything else stays lazy until first placed in a pane.
3. **Activate** — `activate(ctx)` runs once per load/reload. Register tick
   handlers and kick off startup work here.
4. **Mount/Unmount** — pure React, toggled by sidebar selection. Doesn't
   re-run activate/deactivate — your component can mount/unmount many times
   across one activation.
5. **Deactivate** — runs on hot-reload-replace or app shutdown, in this
   order: your `deactivate()` (fire-and-forget, not awaited) → your
   `ctx.onDispose(fn)` callbacks → `ctx.signal` aborted → your tick handler
   unregistered. Don't write an `onDispose` callback that assumes
   `ctx.signal` is already aborted — it isn't yet.
6. **Uninstall** — delete the folder; the next discovery pass removes it.

**Nothing is auto-cleaned up beyond the tick handle and abort signal** — a
plugin that spawns a process or opens a watch must clean it up itself (e.g.
`ctx.onDispose(() => child.kill())`).

## The `PluginApi` surface (what `ctx.api` gives you)

| Surface | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `api.theme` | `{ palette, subscribe(fn) }` | Live-updating palette; restyle with it, never a literal hex. |
| `api.statusIcon` | `{ set(color, tooltip?), get() }` | Colored dot next to your sidebar entry. `color` is `"idle" \| "in-progress" \| "success" \| "warning" \| "error"`. |
| `api.modal` | `{ error(), info(), question(), confirm() }` | Blocking overlay dialogs, all return Promises. |
| `api.sidebar` | `{ setItems(items), setSelected(id) }` | Registers sub-items indented under your sidebar row (`{ id, label, icon?, color?, onClick }`). |
| `api.toast` | `{ show({title?, message, kind?, durationMs?}) }` | Non-blocking notification. |
| `api.ui` | `TextBox, StatusDot, MaskIcon, TextButton, IconButton, IconTextButton, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Toggle, Spinner, ProgressBar, Skeleton, Dropdown, DropdownCheckboxes, DropdownRadio, DropdownImageText, DropdownImageGrid, Tabs, Pagination, Menu, Link, Blanket, Drawer, InlineDialog, Banner, RangeSlider, Calendar, DatePicker, TimePicker, DateTimePicker, CodeTextArea` | The **only** UI kit — always use these instead of raw `<button>`/`<input>`/etc. Every one is palette-driven. See `_template/demos/` for a live example of each. |
| `api.shell` | `{ exec(cmd, args, opts?), spawn(cmd, args, opts?) }` | Arbitrary process execution, no allowlist. `exec` awaits full output; `spawn` streams. Always pass `program`/`args` separately, never a shell string. |
| `api.storage` | `{ get<T>(key), set<T>(key, val), getAll<T>() }` | Per-plugin JSON key/value store. Plaintext — no secrets. |
| `api.fs` | `{ readTextFile, writeTextFile, readDataUrl, listDir, getRootPath, deleteFile, renameFile, watchFile }` | Raw file access scoped to your plugin's own sandboxed folder (`watchFile` is currently a no-op stub). For files *outside* your sandbox (e.g. editing a dotfile in the user's home dir), use `api.shell.exec` instead. |
| `api.log` | `{ info(msg), warn(msg), error(msg) }` | Writes to the status bar and a persistent log file. |
| `api.ai` | `{ run(prompt, opts?) }` → `{ pid, kill(), done }` | Launch point for headless `claude` CLI invocations. |
| `ctx.tick` | `{ register(fn), unregister(), requestWake(afterMs?), setInterval(ms\|null) }` | Scheduled work while your plugin is loaded (independent of whether it's mounted). Throttled when the window is minimized — for background work that must survive that, use the raw escape hatch instead: `invoke("start_interval", { key, intervalMs })` (clamps to >= 1000ms) + `listen("interval-tick:" + key, fn)`, and `invoke("stop_interval", { key })` in `ctx.onDispose`. |

Icon/image props (`IconButton.icon`, etc.) take a `data:` URL: use
`import icon from "./assets/foo.png"` for a bundled asset (esbuild inlines it
as base64), or `api.fs.readDataUrl(path)` for a runtime file. A raw relative
path never resolves — plugin bundles load from a Blob URL, not a file: URL.

## Building

You write `index.tsx` (or `.ts`/`.jsx`/`.js`); it must be built into
`dist/index.js` before the host will load it. From inside your plugin's own
folder, one-time setup then build:

```sh
cd plugins           # this folder
npm install esbuild  # once, creates plugins/node_modules + plugins/package.json
node build-plugin.mjs my-plugin           # one-shot build
node build-plugin.mjs my-plugin --watch   # rebuild on save; the host hot-reloads automatically
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — install it first if `npm`/`node`
aren't recognized. `build-plugin.mjs` bundles your entire file tree into a
single ESM file; `react`/`react-dom` (all subpaths, including
`jsx-runtime`) and `@tauri-apps/api/*` are left external since they resolve
at runtime against the host's own instances — don't bundle a second React.

## Type-checking while authoring

`.stewrd/plugin-api.d.ts` (a sibling of this file) declares an ambient
`stewrd-plugin-api` module for editor autocomplete/type-checking only — it's
never loaded at runtime. Reference it from your `index.tsx`:

```ts
/// <reference path="../.stewrd/plugin-api.d.ts" />
import type { PluginContext, PluginApi } from "stewrd-plugin-api";
```

## Sharing a plugin

Plugins are portable: zip up a plugin's folder (including its built `dist/`)
and hand it to someone else, or install it via **Settings > Plugins > Add
plugin** (`.zip`/`.tar`/`.tar.gz`/`.tgz` supported).
